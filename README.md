# KANJI KEEPER (漢字キーパー) 🌸

*Kanji Keeper* is a language learning platform for Japanese. It makes it easier to keep track of new words and expressions you pick up on a daily basis, and allows you to share that knowledge with other users. 

Features

* Basic CRUD app with a favoriting feature for posts

* Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4

* Back-end: Ruby on Rails

* Daily kanji: randomly shows a new word from a json file of joyo kanji (list of 2,136 characters) each day. The data is provided by https://kanjiapi.dev/.

* Furigana to user posts: since logographic Chinese characters are used in the Japanese writing system to represent concepts as a single character, it is impossible to read these without prior exposure to them. Furigana is a reading aid consisting of smaller syllabic characters written in hiragana on top of the word to indicate its pronuncation. https://kuroshiro.org/ is used to convert kanji characters to hiragana.
