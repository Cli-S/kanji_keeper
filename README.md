* Daily kanji: randomly shows a new word from a json file of joyo kanji (list of 2,136 characters) each day. The data is provided by https://kanjiapi.dev/

* Furigana to user posts: since logographic Chinese characters are used in the Japanese writing system to represent concepts as a single character, it is impossible to read these without prior exposure to them. Furigana is a reading aid consisting of smaller syllabic characters written in hiragana on top of the word to indicate its pronuncation. https://kuroshiro.org/ is used to convert kanji characters to hiragana for user posts

* A few gems: CarrierWave for user upload files, Cloudinary for user image storage, Devise for authentication, ...

* Real-time chat: Action Cable integrates full-duplex communications with WebSockets with the rest of the application. Since the connection is persistent, users can submit their messages at the same time and still see their respective messages appear immediately

Many new features to be added soon
